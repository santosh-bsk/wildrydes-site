## Region Selection

This workshop step can be deployed in any AWS region that supports the following services:
- AWS Cognito
- AWS Amplify Console
- AWS CodeCommit

You can refer to the [AWS region table][region-services] in the AWS documentation to see which regions have the supported services. 

Once you've chosen a region, you should deploy all of the resources for this workshop there. Make sure you select your region from the drop down in the upper right corner of the AWS Console before getting started.
