In this workshop, you will deploy a completely [serverless](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/) web application built with AWS services. You can follow this workshop at your own pace using the instructions in this repo or attend a session at an AWS event where it is run.

If you're attending this workshop at an AWS event, your instructor will provide an overview of the steps involved. There are AWS employees available to help with any of your questions - don't be afraid to ask if you get stuck!
